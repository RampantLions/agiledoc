 = Costumer Interview - Alline Watkins - As working at UCSD 2009 = 



- What are working with right now?

What company? What job title? What Tools? What programming language? What does your software do? How many in your team?

{{{
A Web Application for USCD Physical Activity Department

As Java Programmer

GWT, Eclipse, Java

3 programmers
}}}


- What are the most important problems you are dealing at your work at the moment?

{{{ 
Very bad communication, constant but not efficient. 
}}}


- How do you document your software? If you do. if no, how do your users learn to use your software?

{{{ 
No Documentation, only some architecture diagrams . 
Right now , it is a prototype and the few users are tester that use with the programmers to guide them.
}}}


- Do you have current documentation requirements?

{{{ 
No.
}}}


- How does the interaction between Stakeholders and Developers on your team happen?

is it problematic? how do requirements are communicated? how the developer team reports work?

{{{ 
Weekly meeting the are very superficial on the technical situation of the software.

 }}}


- What do you think about the source code being opened to stakeholders in a way they can understand and comment it?

{{{
It is going to take a while for them to get used of it. No time available to change behaviors.
}}}

- What do you think about specification/documentation being generated from inside the Source Code?

{{{
In this project at this moment it will be a very big change of behavior.
Is going to be a lot of time to adapt to this new behavior and the project is already running out of time.
(But the project totally fails anyway at the end)
Self generated documentation will probably not solve the big scope problem.
}}}


- if stakeholders could send messages to the programmers inside the source code, in a very contextualized way?

would it save you money? would it help your development process? would it make it worst? Hurt?

{{{
For the stakeholders to stop to analyse the source code it will take time they need to write the Use Cases.
}}}


- Are you able to drive test our Software?

{{{
In a very small portion of the scope.
}}}

- Do you think you could refactoring your Source Code to take advantages out of it?

{{{
In a very very small portion of the scope.
}}}

- How much an automatic generated User Manual is worth for you?

{{{
Depends on how good it is going to be at the end.
}}}


- How much you think you could pay to use Code Sponge?
{{{
If it helps, a lot.
