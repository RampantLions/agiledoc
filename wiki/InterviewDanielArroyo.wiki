08:35 
Daniel: ok, so you have a time now
08:36 
eu: can i ask you some question
 
Daniel: sure
08:39 
eu: ok
  
i just want to know how are you developming software
  
you use your computer at home
  
right?
 
Daniel: yes
08:40 
eu: what tools do you use?
 
Daniel: titanium studio
 
eu: ok
  
what is that?
08:41 
i am looking at it
 
Daniel: http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-studio/
 
eu: can you develop on your mobile?
 
Daniel: no
08:42 
eu: so you have to install this IDE on your PC?
08:43 
Daniel: yes
08:44 
eu: ok
  
but you can make apps for mobile
  
right?
 
Daniel: for mobile yes
  
on mobile no
 
eu: ok
  
good
08:45 
would you like to develop on your mobile?
  
or tablet?
  
or browser?
 
Daniel: not really
  
;(
  
;)
  
I don't see the point
 
eu: ok
  
so
  
you are always at home when you want to work
  
rigth?
08:47 
Daniel: not all times
  
but I have a laptop
 
eu: ok
  
do you prefer laptop or desktop?
08:48 
Daniel: desktop because of the bigger screen
 
eu: ok
  
that is very commom
  
does it happen that you need to make some changes in your code and you are not at home and you dont have your laptop?
08:49 
Daniel: yes, but it can wait
08:50 
eu: ok
08:51 
so just to do my statistics
  
from 1 to 5
  
how much wolud you like to develop using your browser?
08:52 
Daniel: 3
 
eu: that is not so bad
  
:-)
 
Daniel: it has benefits if it worked
  
I just have my doubts that it's possible
 
eu: how much would you like titanium to have a broswer/ mobile environment?
08:53 
1 to 5
 
Daniel: but if you showed me a browser-based experience that worked, I would like it
 
eu: ok
 
Daniel: 4
 
eu: I am trying hard
  
I want it for me
  
install and run eclipse it is a hell
08:54 
and I want to develop everywhere
  
:-)
  
just to finish
  
you develop php, right?
08:55 
Daniel: ye
 
eu: are you developing native app too?
 
Daniel: what is native?
  
mobile?
 
eu: android?
 
Daniel: no
 
eu: ok
08:56 
your app was develop in php for mobile browser right?
 
Daniel: no
  
well
 
eu: ?
 
Daniel: what app?
 
eu: how was it?
  
flaretag mobile app
  
you showed me
  
it was cool
 
Daniel: I don't have a mobile app
  
it's a mobile website
  
usint PHP yes
 
eu: but was in the mobile browser
  
yes
08:57 
ok
  
exactly
  
was good
  
so just to make sure
  
you make changes on your source code
  
and them you test it lovally
  
locally
  
rigth?
 
Daniel: mos times ;)
08:58 
eu: and them you update your source code on that cloud
  
phofog
  
you dont need to compile anything
  
right?
 
Daniel: nope
 
eu: it runs straight on the source files, right?
  
you dont have any precompiled classes?
08:59 
all php script files?
 
Daniel: nothing like that in php
 
eu: do you have outside of php?
 
Daniel: no
 
eu: ok
  
so just to confirm
09:00 
you update your source code on the phpfog git repository
  
and the changes go straight to the end users
  
right?
  
that is so much easier than java :-)
 
Daniel: yes
09:01 
eu: ok!
  
that is all
  
:-)
  
such a good customer you are
09:02 
:-)
 
Daniel: really?
  
I feel that I don't have time for much
 
eu: so easy to obtain answers
  
not really
  
you are my basement
  
:-D
09:03 
Daniel: basement? that sounds dark and wet
 
eu: :-)
  
solid and concrete
09:04 
Daniel: that too
