Live Source is a Web Toolkit that helps software companies develop software faster and cheaper. Live Source improves communication and automatically generates plans, documents, and metrics directly from the source code of a software project without extra effort from the developers team. There is a prototype already developed for the product.




The description looks like snake oil.

I always hated self generated documents, They suck.
What metrics are those?? what plans?? What docs?? are they good?

There is always an extra effort for everything, nothing is free.

A prototype already developed and not luched yet?, means your loose your time.
